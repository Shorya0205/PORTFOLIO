# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio site. I'm Shorya Guptaâ€”a full-stack developer who loves building things that make a difference. This is my little corner of the web where I showcase my work, skills, and a bit about who I am.

## What's inside?
- A clean, modern, and fully responsive design (try it on your phone!)
- A navbar that works great on any device
- Animated sections and smooth scrolling
- A contact form that actually works (give it a try!)
- My favorite projects and the tech I use

## How to use this site
1. **Download or clone** this folder.
2. Just open `index.html` in your browser. That's itâ€”no setup, no build tools, just pure HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Want to make it yours?
- Change my name, photo, or bio in `index.html`.
- Swap out the projects for your own.
- Edit the skills to match what you know best.
- Play with the colors in `style.css` if you want a new vibe.
- Replace the profile image with your own.

## Why did I build this?
I wanted a portfolio that's easy to update, looks good everywhere, and feels like me. If you like it, feel free to use it as a template for your own site. If you have questions or want to connect, just use the contact form or find me on LinkedIn/GitHub.
